Hi, I'm Jarek - Coding Extraordinaire (in progress)

I'm a Chemistry PhD student utilizing code to automate data processing, curve fitting, and scientific problem solving.
I also build small tools and scripts to keep lab equiptment running efficiently and correctly. Hopefully some of these fixes are useful to you!

My overarching style is to hold practicality above all else. Functionality > aesthetics all day. I make my best effort to keep scripts readable and obvious to keep them reliable and modifiable on the fly. 

I'm open to colloboration on any scripts I publish. If there is something I overlooked or is not optimal, please let me know! I am always looking to learn and develop as a coder.

### Lab Instrument Troubleshooting

**[AKTA-UNICORN software connection fix (link)]** - Last Updated: 07/14/25

Powershell + registry patch to force connection between an inserted USB-ethernet adaptor with AKTA Pure GPC. Keeps AKTA connecton stable in environments where windows forcefully blocks communication. Includes low-weight watchdog script for connection monitoring with pop-up alerts to catch mid-run disconnections. Connection logs are saved and can be used to help diagnose software connection failures.

**[Spectral Data Analysis (link)]**  **[IN PROGRESS]**

Python script to load, plot, and fit UV/vis absorption spectra. Primarily designed for analysis and modeling of aggregation pathways in organic semiconductor (For derivatives such as Naphthalene Diimide, Perylene Diimide, Thiophene). Hosts a variety of functions, such as: vibronic band deconvolution (gaussian peak fitting), supramolecular polymerization mechanism fitting, degree of aggregation determination, exciton bandwidth and coupling calculations, oscillator strength calculations, and more. While currently manual, the end goal is the automation of analysis, starting from data acquisition and ending in publishable python plots.
